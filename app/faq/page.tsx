        q: 'Is JigMerge really free?',
        a: 'Yes. The game is free to play in the browser. There are no accounts, paid levels, or premium unlocks required to access the core experience.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Do I need to download anything?',
        a: 'No. JigMerge runs directly in your browser. If the page loads, you can start playing without installing an app or extension.',
    },
    {
        q: 'What devices can I play on?',
        a: 'JigMerge is designed for modern desktop and mobile browsers. The layout adapts for phones, tablets, and larger screens so the game remains playable across common device sizes.',
    },
    {
        q: 'How does tile merging work?',
        a: 'When adjacent tiles are both in their correct positions, they merge into a single group. That group then moves together, reducing board complexity and helping you build momentum as the image comes together.',
    },
    {
        q: 'How many levels are available?',
        a: 'The current site includes 25 handcrafted levels across 5 categories. Each category is meant to offer a slightly different visual feel while preserving the same core rules.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Can I save my progress?',
        a: 'The current experience does not use account-based cloud saving. Some small gameplay preferences may be stored locally in your browser, but progress is not synced across devices.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Does JigMerge work offline?',
        a: 'An internet connection is required to load the site and game assets. After the page loads, gameplay itself is lightweight, but the site is not designed as a fully offline product.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Is JigMerge safe for children?',
        a: 'The game is designed to be family-friendly and does not include chat, user profiles, or account creation. Parents should still supervise use and review our Parents & Safety Guide and Privacy Policy if children will use the site regularly.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Do you collect personal information?',
        a: 'You can browse and play without creating an account. If you contact us by email, your message is handled through your email provider and our inbox. Our Privacy Policy explains the limited data processing involved in running the site and any third-party ad services.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Why are ads shown on some pages?',
        a: 'Ads help support hosting and maintenance so the game can remain free. We aim to keep ads secondary to the main content and not place them in a way that overwhelms gameplay or trust pages.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Can I report a bug or inaccurate page?',
        a: 'Yes. Please use the Contact page and include the page URL, device, browser, and a short description of the issue. Clear reports help us fix problems faster.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Where should I start if I am new?',
        a: 'The best starting points are the Play page, the How to Play guide, and a few easier categories. Once you understand the merge mechanic, the strategy articles in the blog will make more sense too.',
