                    This page explains how JigMerge uses cookies and similar browser-side technologies. We include
                    both traditional cookies and local browser storage here because, from a visitor&apos;s perspective,
                    they are often part of the same privacy question: what information is stored in the browser and why?
                </p>

                <h2>1. What Cookies Are</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small text files that websites or third-party services place in your browser. Some
                    cookies are essential for delivering content or maintaining service functionality. Others are used
                    for advertising, measurement, or personalization.
                </p>

                <h2>2. What Browser Storage Is</h2>
                <p>
                    Browser storage, including localStorage, lets a site remember simple information on your device.
                    In JigMerge, this can be used for lightweight gameplay state such as whether the tutorial has been
                    completed. Unlike account-based storage, this information stays in your browser unless you clear it.
                </p>

                <h2>3. How JigMerge Uses These Technologies</h2>
                <p>JigMerge currently uses or may rely on the following categories:</p>

                <h3>Local gameplay storage</h3>
                <p>
                    The current game stores a limited tutorial-completion flag in your browser so returning players do
                    not need to repeat the tutorial every time. This is functional browser storage tied to the local
                    device and browser.
                </p>

                <h3>Site delivery and security technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    Hosting and infrastructure providers may use technical mechanisms necessary to deliver pages,
                    improve reliability, and protect against abuse. These may vary depending on deployment and browser
                    behavior.
                </p>

                <h3>Advertising technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    If ads are shown on the site, third-party providers such as Google AdSense may use cookies or
                    similar technologies to serve, limit, measure, or personalize advertisements in accordance with
                    their own policies and applicable law.
                </p>

                <h2>4. What We Do Not Currently Claim to Use</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not currently state that JigMerge runs Google Analytics on the site. If analytics tooling is
                    added in the future, this Cookie Policy and the Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Managing Cookies and Browser Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    You can control cookies and local storage through your browser settings. Keep in mind that blocking
                    or clearing storage may affect parts of the site, including saved tutorial state or ad preferences.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Google Ad Controls</h2>
                <p>
                    If Google advertising is active on the site, you can learn more or manage certain ad preferences
                    through Google&apos;s own tools, including{' '}

                    </a>{' '}
                    and Google&apos;s{' '}

                    </a>.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may revise this page if the game changes, if we add or remove service providers, or if legal
                    requirements change. When we do, we will update the date at the top of the page.
                </p>
